```css
:root {
  --primary-navy: #1a365d;
  --primary-army: #2d5016;
  --primary-airforce: #1e3a8a;
  --accent-gold: #d4af37;
  --accent-red: #dc2626;
  /* ... other variables */
}
```

- **Events**: Update the `upcomingEvents` and `pastEvents` arrays in `src/pages/Events.js`
- **News Articles**: Modify the `newsArticles` array in `src/pages/News.js`
- **Gallery Items**: Update the `mediaItems` array in `src/pages/Gallery.js`

### Images
Replace placeholder images with actual photos:

- Ensure images are optimized for web (recommended: WebP format, max 800px width)
- Use consistent aspect ratios for better layout
